## ROAD TRAFFIC FATALITY IN US

### INTRODUCTION

Road traffic crashes (RTCs) are responsible for a substantial fraction of morbidity and mortality and are responsible for more years of life lost than most of human diseases.  Different driver and vehicle related factors are believed to be contributing factors for the traffic trauma in the globe. This project intends to build a shiny app that will help to visualize the traffic fatality by disaggregating different human and vehicle relate factors  by exploring the 2016 United States NHTSA Fatality Reporting Analysis System Data Set. The visualization will be solely aimed at simple descriptive statistics.  

### DATA QUESTION

Literatures are investigating the causes of road traffic accidents in many ways starting from behavioral factors to the extent of vehicle types. Following literature, this project wants to explore those facts in detail by posing a question of correlation among driver characteristics, vehicle characteristics and environmental factors. In this project, a detailed exploratory analysis is will be performed and data will be visualized by shiny app. The main issues to be discussed in this  project are as follows.

* ***Driver characteristics***
    + Age
    + Gender
    + Driving under Influence
    + Distraction
    + Speeding

* ***Environmental and road characteristics***
    + Weather conditions
    + Road types
    + Time of accident

* ***Vehicle Characteristics***
    + Types of vehicles


### DATA SOURCE

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a huge open data source on road traffic fatalities.  NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) provides data about fatal crashes involving all types of vehicles. FARS is a census of fatal motor vehicle crashes with a set of data files documenting all qualifying fatalities that occurred within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico since 1975. To qualify as a FARS case, the crash had to involve a motor vehicle traveling on a traffic way customarily open to the public, and must have resulted in the death of a motorist or a non-motorist within 30 days of the crash.
